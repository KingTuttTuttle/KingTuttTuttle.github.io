## Getting Started
These are the cycling experiences of **Tyler "King Tutt" Tuttle**.

When I arrived in Sasebo, walking was my means of trasportation. I was tossed about purchasing a vehicle here simply because it would have been a lot to maintain and I would be unable to take my car back to the United States. While walking around, it was easy to observe how harsh the weather was on metal objects due to the humidity and rain. Also, Sasebo has a designated area called the "Bicycle Graveyard".
